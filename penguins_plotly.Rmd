Scatterplot of penguin flipper_length_mm (x) vs body_mass_g (y) with points 
having dif colors based on species
```{r}
penguins_graph <- ggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g))+
  geom_point(aes(color=species))+
  labs(x="Flipper length (mm)", y="Body Mass (g)", title="Penguins")
  
ggplotly(penguins_graph)
```

```{r}
datatable(penguins)
```

i'm going to make a column graph (using geom_bar) of counts of penguins by 
island with fill color indicating penguin species.
then were going to save that with ggsave().

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = island)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = species))

#save the plot as a new jpg file in a folder 

ggsave(here("final_figures","island_counts.png"))
```
